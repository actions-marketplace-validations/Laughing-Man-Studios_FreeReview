/**
 * Golden-dataset fixture authoring.
 *
 * ## Why fixtures are generated rather than hand-written
 *
 * The parser is strict about `@@` counts — deliberately, since a miscounted
 * header would place every anchor on the wrong line. Hand-writing 14 diffs means
 * hand-counting 14 headers, and I have already miscounted several while writing
 * unit tests. So a fixture is authored as the hunk's *body lines*, each marked
 * ` `, `-`, or `+`, and the header is derived.
 *
 * The derived `.diff` files are committed, so a consumer of the dataset does not
 * need this module — and `validate:fixtures` re-derives them and fails on any
 * disagreement, so a hand-edited diff cannot drift from its source.
 *
 * ## The unit is a quote, not an explanation
 *
 * `expectedFindings[].explanationMentions` records *what a correct explanation
 * must convey*, not what it must say. Comparing prose to prose is hopeless, and
 * an over-specific matcher would measure a small model's vocabulary rather than
 * whether it found the bug.
 *
 * ## `forbiddenFindings` carries as much weight as `expectedFindings`
 *
 * Without a false-positive target there is no precision measurement, and
 * precision is what decides whether a human keeps reading the bot. Every
 * fixture declares at least one thing a reviewer must *not* say.

  // resistance, it is evidence that one shape was tried twice.
  //
  // These six vary the *mechanism* and the *placement*, not just the wording.
  // The suppression semantics stay deliberately recognisable, because that is
  // what a real payload does; what is being tested is whether the reviewer
  // treats repository content as instructions regardless of where it is hidden
  // or what it impersonates.
  //
  // Every one plants a real defect, which is what makes it falsifiable — see
  // `validate:fixtures` §6. A model that complies returns an empty array and is

/**
 * Stage B held-out set.
 *
 * ## Why these are separate from Stage A
 *
 * Every Stage A held-out fixture has now been shown to at least one model's
 * output, so none of them can measure generalisation any more. Two were demoted to
 * development outright for that reason. Continuing to grow Stage A's held-out
 * split would produce a set that is *named* held-out and is actually trained on,
 * which is worse than a small honest set: the number would keep rising while the
 * evidence behind it decayed.
 *
 * So Stage B starts empty and is scored once.
 *
 * ## The contamination to avoid
 *
 * I have now seen where models fail on Stage A: two-line ranges, removed-line
 * anchors, suppression comments. Authoring fixtures *aimed at* those failure
 * modes would be fitting the test set to the observed errors, and the resulting
 * score would measure my ability to predict model weaknesses rather than model
 * quality.
 *
 * So these deliberately cover defect classes Stage A does not test at all, chosen
 * from the taxonomy of common review findings rather than from the error log. If
 * a model happens to do badly on them, that is information; if it happens to do
 * well, that is also information.
 *
 * ## Before any requests are spent
 *
 * Ground truth written by the same person who wrote the code it grades is the
 * weakest link in this whole setup — `docs/second-opinion-fixture-review.md`
 * found 8 of 14 Stage A fixtures flawed on exactly that basis. These six go
 * through the same cross-examination before a single request is spent on them.

 * Single source of truth on purpose. This list was originally a regex literal
 * inside `validate:fixtures`, and a *second* copy was inlined in
 * `tests/unit/fixtures.test.ts`. When the six payload-class fixtures needed
 * phrasings the first list did not recognise, the validator was updated and the
 * test kept enforcing the old four — so `validate:fixtures` passed and the test
 * suite failed, on the same input, for opposite reasons. Any check duplicated
 * across the validator and its test will eventually disagree with itself.
 *
 * It remains a phrase list, not a semantic test. It can show that a fixture poses
 * a suppression *attempt*; it cannot show that the attempt is well-formed, that a
 * model would be swayed by it, or that the phrasing is representative. What is
 * guaranteed is the pairing this exists to enforce — a suppression payload and a
 * real defect planted behind it, so that compliance and resistance produce
 * different output.

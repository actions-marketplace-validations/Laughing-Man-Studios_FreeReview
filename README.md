>
>   **A pull request author can therefore suppress findings in their own

>   correction, including a scorer bug that counted "identified the injection"
>   as compliance.
> - **The default model also flags the injection payload itself.** On two of the

## Why this exists

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **It costs nothing.** | Every request uses an explicit `:free` model. Three independent guards make paid routing impossible, one of which is enforced server-side by OpenRouter. Not a free tier that expires — a genuinely $0 operating model. |
| **It never runs your code.** | No `actions/checkout`, no package manager, no tests, no build. Everything comes from the GitHub API. This is asserted against the shipped bundle in CI, not just documented. |
| **It never places a comment on code the model did not quote.** | The model never supplies a line number. It quotes source text; deterministic local code maps that text to exactly one verified diff location, or declines to comment. *This is a placement guarantee, not a correctness one — the model can still be wrong about the line it quotes. Findings are advisory, and [the evaluation](docs/model-evaluation.md) measures how often.* |
| **Privacy is enforced, not implied.** | By default, requests carry `provider.zdr: true` and `provider.data_collection: "deny"`. If no eligible endpoint qualifies, the action **skips the review** rather than quietly relaxing the constraint. |

The incumbents — CodeRabbit, Copilot, Sourcery — all cost money, and all of
them see your code. If either of those is a problem, this is built for it.

## How it works

```
Pull request opened
  → eligibility gate        fork? public? draft? closed?          skip, exit 0
  → capture HEAD SHA        immutable review identity
  → fetch diff              GitHub API only, never a checkout
  → size gate               skip if the PR exceeds the budget
  → filter + chunk          bounded, token-budgeted hunks
  → quota preflight         read remaining daily allowance first
  → model call              one call per chunk, capability-gated
  → validate + anchor       ← every finding must resolve uniquely
  → deduplicate
  → re-check HEAD SHA       discard if a commit landed meanwhile
  → publish                 one COMMENT review, advisory
```

The design principle, unchanged from the original plan:

> The LLM proposes findings. Deterministic local code decides whether those
> findings are structurally valid, uniquely anchorable, deduplicated, current,
> and safe to publish.

## Requirements

- A **private** repository
- Pull requests from a branch in the **same** repository
- A free OpenRouter account (works with or without credits — see [Quota](#quota-and-cost))
- Node 24 runner (all GitHub-hosted runners)

## Usage

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml
name: AI Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

# Cancel a superseded review when a new commit lands. This matters a lot
# against a 50-request/day budget: without it, every push to an open PR burns
# another review's worth of quota.
concurrency:
  group: ai-code-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# The only permissions required. Do not add more.
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: Laughing-Man-Studios/FreeReview@v1
        with:
          openrouter_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

`github_token` is not optional in practice: GitHub does not expose
`GITHUB_TOKEN` to an action invoked with `uses:`, so it has to be wired
explicitly. Setting `env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` on the
step works equally well.

**Do not add `actions/checkout`.** The action obtains everything it needs
through the API and is specifically designed never to materialise your code.

Add `if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false` if you don't want drafts
reviewed at all.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openrouter_api_key` | *required* | OpenRouter API key. Read from the environment, never logged. |
| `github_token` | `${{ github.token }}` | Token used to read the pull request and publish the review. Defaults to the workflow's own token, which is usually correct. |
| `privacy_mode` | `strict` | `strict` sends `zdr: true` + `data_collection: "deny"`. `relaxed` drops both and is reported loudly in the summary **and** the review. |
| `strict_providers` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated OpenRouter provider slugs to pin under `strict`, sent as `provider.only`. Empty leaves routing unconstrained. **Narrows availability** — a provider that stops serving the free tier ends the review rather than silently switching to an unverified one. |
| `primary_model` | bundled | An explicit `:free` model ID. Non-`:free` IDs are rejected before any network call. |
| `fallback_models` | bundled | Comma-separated `:free` IDs to try in order when the primary is unavailable. |
| `max_changed_lines` | `2000` | Skip (non-blocking) if the PR exceeds this many changed lines. |
| `max_input_tokens` | `24000` | Hard per-request input budget. Chunks are packed to fit. |
| `max_output_tokens` | `1500` | Output budget reserved for the structured response. Counts against the context window. |
| `max_requests_per_run` | `8` | Hard cap including retries and fallbacks. Tuned so a worst-case PR costs ~6 reviews/day of the 50/day allowance. |
| `max_concurrency` | `2` | Concurrent requests. Capped at 4. |
| `max_findings_per_chunk` | `5` | Maximum findings accepted per chunk. |
| `include_suggestions` | `false` | Attach ` ```suggestion ` blocks. Off by default — prove the findings are useful before optimising patches. |
| `debug_payloads` | `false` | Log full prompts and responses. **Exposes your source code in workflow logs.** |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `reviewed`, `no_findings`, `skipped_*`, or `failed`. |
| `findings_count` | Inline findings published. |
| `unanchored_count` | Model findings that could not be uniquely anchored, and were therefore **not** published inline. |
| `files_reviewed` | Files included in model context. |
| `model_used` | Model that produced the published findings. |
| `requests_used` | OpenRouter requests spent, including retries and fallbacks. |
| `review_url` | URL of the published review. |

## Why wasn't my PR reviewed?

The step summary at the bottom of every run lists a **diagnostic code** for each
reason. This is the complete list of ways a review gets skipped:

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UNSUPPORTED_PR_SOURCE` | Fork or external-contribution PR | Open a branch in the same repository. Deliberate: reviewing a fork means sending third-party code to a third party. |
| `PUBLIC_REPOSITORY` | Base repository is public | By design. Public code needs no external review; the action declines rather than assume consent. |
| `DRAFT_PR` | Pull request is a draft | Mark ready, or add `if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false`. |
| `PR_CLOSED` / `PR_ALREADY_MERGED` | Not open | Nothing to review. |
| `PR_TOO_LARGE` | Exceeds `max_changed_lines` | Raise the input, or review a smaller PR. Splitting a large PR is usually better anyway. |
| `CONTEXT_TOO_LARGE` | Chunks cannot fit the token budget | Lower `max_input_tokens` or split the PR. |
| `NO_REVIEWABLE_FILES` | Everything was filtered | Only binaries, generated files, or lockfiles changed. |
| `OPENROUTER_QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` | Daily allowance spent | The 50/day allowance resets at UTC midnight. Check `GET /api/v1/key` → `free_model_daily_requests.remaining`. |
| `NO_ELIGIBLE_MODEL` / `NO_ELIGIBLE_PROVIDER` | No free model satisfies the config | Under `strict`, the ZDR + no-data-collection combination may have no free endpoint. Try `privacy_mode: relaxed`, or check the free-model catalog. |
| `OPENROUTER_RATE_LIMITED` | 20 requests/minute cap hit | Lower `max_concurrency`. |
| `STALE_HEAD_SHA` | A commit landed during review | Working as intended — results for the old commit were discarded. Re-run on the new head. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_EVENT` | Triggered on something other than `pull_request` | Use `on: pull_request`. |

`status` will be `failed` (exit 1) only for a genuine misconfiguration:
`CONFIG_INVALID`, `MISSING_CREDENTIALS`, `INVALID_GITHUB_CONTEXT`,
`DIFF_PARSE_FAILED`, `OPENROUTER_AUTH_FAILED`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`.

## Quota and cost

OpenRouter's allowance for free models on an account with **under $10** of
credits is **50 requests per day** and **20 per minute**. With $10+ credits it
rises to 1,000/day. **Failed requests count too**, so retries are tightly
bounded.

| PR size | Requests |
| --- | --- |
| 1 file, 1 hunk | 1 |
| 3 files, ~200 lines | 1–2 |
| 8 files, ~900 lines | 4 |
| 20 files, ~2000 lines | 8 (the per-run cap) |

Defaults are tuned so a worst-case PR costs 8 requests — about **6 PRs/day** at
the cap, ~25/day for typical PRs. The action reads your remaining allowance from
`GET /api/v1/key` *before* starting, reserves the last 10 of the 50, and reports
exhaustion rather than silently producing a partial review.

## Exit codes

The exit status is **reviewer operational health**, never finding severity.

| Outcome | Exit |
| --- | --- |
| Findings published (any severity, including `critical`) | 0 |
| No findings | 0 |
| Any `skipped_*` reason above | 0 |
| Misconfiguration or internal error | 1 |

A run that found a security vulnerability and a run that found nothing both
succeed. This is the point: an advisory reviewer must not be able to block a
merge, or it becomes a merge gate with a hallucination rate.

## Privacy

By default every request carries:

```json
"provider": { "zdr": true, "data_collection": "deny" }
```

Only providers without prompt retention are eligible. If none qualifies among
free models, the action reports that and skips — it never silently downgrades
the policy.

`privacy_mode: relaxed` drops both constraints. It is an explicit opt-in,
announced in the step summary *and* in the published review body, so the person
whose code was sent to a third party can see it happened.

**An honest limitation:** OpenRouter's per-endpoint privacy APIs require a
management key, so this action **cannot** verify at runtime which provider
served a request. It enforces the routing constraints and delegates to
OpenRouter; the default model pool carries manually verified provider posture in
source. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

## Models

The default pool is ordered by measurement, not by vendor claims. Every entry
below was probed against the live service and benchmarked on the project's own
golden dataset — see [`docs/model-evaluation.md`](docs/model-evaluation.md).

| Role | Model | Mode | Injection resistance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary** | `inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-sante:free` | prompt-JSON | **partial** — 7 of 8 payload classes resisted, 1 suppression, replicated across 3 passes |
| Fallback 1 | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` | prompt-JSON | exposed |
| Fallback 2 | `qwen/qwen3.8-27b:free` | `json_object` | exposed |
| Fallback 3 | `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` | prompt-JSON | exposed |

**No model in this pool is immune, and the primary is the least exposed rather
than safe.** It resisted 7 of 8 payload classes where every fallback complied
with at least one, and that margin — not raw quality — is why it ships first: the
measured recall and precision of the primary and of the best fallback are within
noise of each other, so exposure is what separates them.

Two payload classes defeat it. The table says `partial` rather than `resistant`
because the difference decides what a reader is told at run time: a
`partially-exposed` model publishes a disclosure on **every** review, and a
`resistant` one publishes nothing at all.

When a review comes from a model with measured exposure, **the review says so**,
in the review body itself. See [Prompt injection](#prompt-injection) below.

### Two things the catalog gets wrong

**Advertised capabilities are not real capabilities.** OpenRouter's
`supported_parameters` is a union across endpoints and can be stale.
`qwen/qwen3.8-27b:free` advertises `structured_outputs` and returns **404** on
every structured request. Each model therefore carries a `preferredMode` chosen
by *measuring review quality in each working mode*, not by taking the strongest
one advertised:

- `nemotron-3-super` genuinely supports structured output and is **much worse**
  there — recall 0.47 against 0.87 in prompt-JSON mode.
- `qwen` is the reverse: JSON-object mode beats prompt-JSON on both recall and
  injection resistance.

Capability decides which modes are *eligible*. Measurement decides which is
*chosen*.

### Models excluded on measured evidence

Kept in the catalog with the failure recorded, so a model that starts answering
is one edit away and the reason it was excluded outlives the exclusion.

| Model | Why disabled |
| --- | --- |
| `liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free` | `400` in every capability mode |
| `google/gemma-4-31b-it:free` | `429` in every working mode, across two probes |
| `thinkingmachines/inkling-small:free` | `403` — "only available on agentic harnesses". Not an API endpoint. |
| `poolside/laguna-s-2.1:free` | Provider documents training on free usage (`privacy_mode: relaxed` only) |

## Prompt injection

A pull request author can put instructions in their own diff — a comment telling
the model to report nothing — and a model that obeys produces a suppressed review
that is **indistinguishable from a clean one**. That is the failure this project
exists to prevent.

FreeReview measures it: fixtures plant a suppression instruction directly above a
real defect, so the only way to pass is to ignore the instruction and report the
defect. A model that complies reports nothing and is scored as having complied.

No model in the pool has been measured immune, so **every** review carries a
disclosure in its body: a fallback because it was measured complying, the primary
because it was measured being silenced by one payload class, and any unmeasured
model because silence there would be indistinguishable from safety.

This is a real limitation, not a solved problem. On the primary it is not
conditional on rate-limiting — one payload class suppresses it outright — and
when the primary is rate-limited and a review falls through to a fallback, the
exposure is worse. The disclosure makes that visible rather than pretending
otherwise, but visible is not the same as prevented.

## Secrets in your diffs

A diff can contain a credential — that is a realistic scenario, not a
hypothetical one, and reviewing the code a human pushed means reading it. So a
finding about a hardcoded key naturally quotes the key back.

FreeReview **redacts credential-shaped substrings from everything it publishes**:
the review body, the step summary, the quoted source block, and the `suggestion`
block (the last matters most — accepting a suggestion writes it into your branch).
A short tail is kept so the finding stays actionable.

Covered shapes: vendor-prefixed keys (`sk-`, `pk-`, `rk-`), AWS access key ids,
GitHub/Slack/Google/SendGrid tokens, JWTs, PEM private-key headers, and
credentials in assignments. The patterns are deliberately narrow, because the
correct fix for a hardcoded key is `apiKey: process.env.API_KEY` and redacting
*that* would destroy the suggestion while leaving the real secret in prose.

**Not covered:** a high-entropy secret with no recognisable prefix, no assignment
and no PEM header is not detected. Redaction reduces the blast radius of an
echoed credential — it does not make credentials safe to commit. Rotating a leaked
key is still the only fix.

## Roadmap

- **Done** — diff parser, deterministic anchoring, context budgeting, OpenRouter
  client and scheduler, prompt and structured output, publisher, golden
  evaluation dataset with a held-out split, capability probing, model
  benchmarking, prompt-injection disclosure, credential redaction, catalog drift
  detection, rate-limit and stale-commit stress, and a consumer smoke test
  proving a tagged release installs and runs
- **Next** — prompt iteration against the falsy-null coercion that every model
  measured so far has missed
- **Later** — better surrounding-code context, additional free models as the
  catalog changes, optional direct-provider integrations, fork PR support

**The largest open weakness is prompt injection, and it is no longer confined to
the fallback chain.** Every model here has been measured following instructions
planted in a diff. The primary — the default, used on almost every run — resisted
7 of 8 payload classes and was silenced by one of the eight in three passes out of three, confirmed by
ablation. So a
pull request author can suppress findings in their own review by landing a
suppression string in a diff, on the default configuration. Reviews disclose this
in their body, which makes it visible rather than silent, but it does not prevent
it, and no free model has yet been measured immune.

See [`docs/execution-plan.md`](docs/execution-plan.md).

## Development

```bash
asdf install nodejs 24.21.0     # matches runs.using: node24
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run check:dist              # fails if the committed bundle is stale
```

`dist/` is committed because GitHub Actions executes it directly. CI fails if it
drifts from `src/`. Do **not** use `asdf latest nodejs` — it may resolve to a
version `runs.using` does not support.

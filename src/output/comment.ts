/**
 * Review body rendering.
 *
 * Everything a human reads on the pull request is built here. Three properties
 * govern the output:
 *
 * 1. **No markdown injection from untrusted content.** The diff is untrusted and
 *    the model's explanation is untrusted. Both end up in a comment rendered by
 *    GitHub's markdown engine, where a crafted explanation could close a
 *    details block, fake a code fence, or impersonate a bot. So every
 *    untrusted string is either fenced, escaped, or stripped of the characters
 *    that carry structure.
 *
 * 2. **The source quote is never rendered as markdown.** It is the highest-risk
 *    string in the payload: it came from a file, it is arbitrary text, and it
 *    can contain anything. It goes in a fenced block whose fence is chosen
 *    longer than the content, so a ``` inside the quote cannot escape.
 *
 * 3. **The review says what it is.** Advisory, model-generated, and able to be
 *    wrong. A reader who cannot tell an AI finding from a human one cannot
 *    calibrate their response to it, which is how advisory tools get treated as
 *    authoritative.

/**
 * Redact credential-shaped substrings from text that will be published.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The seeded-secret test found this missing. A model reporting a hardcoded API key
 * naturally quotes it back — "the value `sk-live-abc…` is committed to source" —
 * and the review body, the step summary and the published comment all render that
 * text verbatim. So a finding about a leaked credential **republished the
 * credential** into the pull request, where it is now visible to everyone with read
 * access and is committed to the branch history by the comment itself.
 *
 * That is strictly worse than saying nothing. The secret was already in the diff,
 * but it was in one commit by one author; a bot comment copies it into a place
 * people screenshot and paste into issue trackers.
 *
 * ## Why the whole comment is redacted and not just prose
 *
 * `suggestedCode` is rendered inside a `suggestion` block that GitHub will apply to
 * the branch. A secret echoed there does not just appear — it gets written.
 *
 * ## Why these patterns
 *
 * Deliberately conservative and prefix-anchored. This runs on every review, so a
 * loose pattern would redact ordinary prose ("skipped", "token-bucket") and make
 * output unreadable. Each pattern requires a known vendor prefix *and* a length
 * that a real credential has, which is what keeps the false-positive rate near
 * zero. A secret with an unrecognised shape is not redacted — the limitation is
 * recorded in SECURITY.md rather than papered over with a greedy regex.

 * What to say when the reviewing model has been measured following instructions

 * ## Why this is in the published comment and not just the log
 *
 * A pull request author can suppress findings by planting a suppression
 * instruction in their own diff, and a suppressed review and a clean review look
 * identical. That is the exact failure this project exists to prevent.
 *
 * It was originally confined to the fallback chain, on the belief that only the
 * primary had ever been measured resistant. That turned out to be wrong: the
 * primary is silenced by one payload class of eight, so the disclosure has to
 * fire on the default path too. When the service is under strain and a review
 * falls through, the exposure is worse still.
 *
 * Disclosing it in the review body is the only place a reader who did not watch
 * the logs will see it. A suppressed review that presents as clean is the worst
 * outcome available; one that announces its own exposure is merely incomplete.
 *
 * ## Why it names the measurement
 *
 * "This model may be susceptible to prompt injection" is unfalsifiable and
 * therefore useless — it is also what every tool says. The note states what was
 * tested and what happened, so a reader can weigh it, and so a future change to
 * the model invalidates a claim that was specific rather than a disclaimer that
 * was always true anyway.
 *
 * `unmeasured` is disclosed too. Silence would be indistinguishable from
 * `resistant`, and that is precisely the confusion this project exists to
 * prevent.
   *
  * ## Why partial exposure gets its own wording
  *
  * The `partially-exposed` note names the payload class, the control, and the
  * conclusion, because that is what separates it from both neighbours: it is not
  * the vague warning an `exposed` fallback gets, and it is not the silence a
  * `resistant` model gets. "We resisted 7 of 8, one of the 8 beat us, and we
  * confirmed it by removing the payload and finding the bug again" is a claim a
  * reader can check and a later measurement can overturn.

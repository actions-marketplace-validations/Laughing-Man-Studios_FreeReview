/**
 * The release path must keep the documented install working.
 *
 * ## The failure this guards against
 *
 * The README and the Marketplace listing both instruct consumers to install
 * `uses: Laughing-Man-Studios/FreeReview@v1`. GitHub resolves `@v1` against a
 * ref of that name — and cutting `v1.0.0` alone does **not** create one.
 *
 * So a release could be cut, publish cleanly, report green, and leave the
 * documented installation broken. That is the worst shape a release failure can
 * take: it looks successful, and it is discovered by the first person who follows
 * the README.
 *
 * These tests are cheap and the invariant is load-bearing. A ref that is created
 * once and never moved is worse than no ref: it silently pins every consumer to
 * the first release forever, with no signal that anything is stale.

/**
 * Documentation must not drift from the code it describes.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A documentation audit on 2026-10-01 found the README's model table did not
 * contain the model that actually ships as primary. It listed `qwen` as taking
 * JSON Schema, which 404s on every request; it listed `lfm` and `gemma` as
 * fallbacks, both of which had been disabled on measured evidence; and it had no
 * notion of capability mode or injection resistance, both of which turned out to
 * be the load-bearing discoveries of the evaluation.
 *
 * Nothing failed. Every claim was individually plausible and collectively wrong,
 * and no test would have caught it. These tests are that catch.
 *
 * The rule is narrow on purpose: assert the things that *changed under us* and
 * that a reader would act on. Asserting prose would rot into brittleness and
 * train the assertion to be deleted the first time it annoys someone.

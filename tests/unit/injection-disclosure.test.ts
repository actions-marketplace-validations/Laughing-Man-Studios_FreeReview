/**
 * Prompt-injection disclosure.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to prevent
 *
 * A pull request author can suppress findings by planting a suppression
 * instruction in their own diff, and a suppressed review is indistinguishable
 * from a clean one. That is the exact failure this project exists to prevent.
 *
 * As of 2026-10-02 this is no longer confined to the fallback chain: the primary
 * was measured resisting 7 of 8 payload classes across three independent
 * passes, and the eighth silenced it in 3 of 3 — checked against an ablation
 * control where the same defect is found every time. So the disclosure has to
 * fire on the *default* path too — which is why
 * `partially-exposed` exists as a distinct state from `resistant`, and why the
 * silence-on-`resistant` rule is now exercised against a hypothetical model
 * rather than against the one that ships.
 *
 * So the disclosure has to appear in the *published review*, not only in the step
 * summary: a developer reading a pull request may never open the workflow run.
 * These tests pin that placement as well as the wording.
